# Student Score Predictor

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline** designed to predict student scores based on study hours and related factors. It covers every stage of the workflow, from raw data analysis to building and evaluating a predictive model.

The main steps of the project include:
- 📊 **Data Analysis** – exploring the dataset, identifying patterns, and uncovering insights.
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing** – handling missing values, feature scaling, and preparing the data for training.
- 🤖 **Model Training** – implementing regression models to learn from the data.
- 📈 **Evaluation** – testing model accuracy and comparing results to ensure reliable predictions.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to understand how machine learning pipelines are built in practice.
